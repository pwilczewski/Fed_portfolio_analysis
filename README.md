# Open source analysis of the Fed's RMBS portfolio
This repository contains my open source analysis of the Fed's RMBS portfolio. The analysis results are contained as a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pwilczewski/Fed_portfolio_analysis/blob/main/Open_source_analysis_of_the_Fed's_RMBS_portfolio.ipynb), created and run in Google colab. Additionally there are two supporting files - the processed_data.csv file for RMBS position details and one openRMBS.py file for the analysis code.
